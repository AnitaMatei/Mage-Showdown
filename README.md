# Mage Showdown
> A 2D multiplayer shooter with mages. You can cast ice and fire spells, depending on what orb you're currently using, each type having a base spell and a bomb spell. Ice spells can freeze the opponent, whereas fire spells you can cast more often and deal more damage per second with. 

> Created using libgdx, box2d for the graphics and physics, kryonet for the networking part and java fx for the ui. The project was created with the help of https://github.com/HalalaiMircea.
